Hello! Today I am so happy and I will tell you about my hobby.

I love drawing pictures. I started this hobby 6 years ago. Some people think drawing pictures is difficult but I am not. Why? Because you only need passion. I think this hobby is useful because you can use your picture you draw as a gift for your friend and family. It will surprise, too! In the future, I will continue this hobby. I love drawing so much!
