Do you know Chinese chess? From all the hobbies I started in my childhood, Chinese chess is the only hobby stayed with me without being affected by changes happened to me thorough my life. I remember how fascinated when I saw a Chinese chess Board the first time in my life and I urged my elder relatives to teach me how to play it. I remember how I was disappointed that nobody at my age then was interested to play Chinese Chess with me and I used to urge my elder relatives to play with me but they refused at first time. Because they were sure that they will beat me. Finally, they agreed after a lot of urging from me and I won but they told me that they let me win. Afterwards, I had a friend who like Chinese chess as much as I do, we used to meet daily and go to the coast with a small Chinese chess Board and play about 3 matches a day, also we used to get Chinese chess books and apply and discuss the matches together. That is my hobby, and you? Donâ€™t be afraid to tell me about your hobby, maybe you have hobby like me.
